# POWER LEARN PROJECT FEBRUARY COHORT 2025

## Overview
This project contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts and functionalities. Each script serves a different purpose, providing interactive experiences for users.

## Scripts

### 1. Personalized Greeting App (`week1/weeklycode.py`)
A simple application that prompts the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a personalized greeting message.

### 2. Random Joke Generator (`week1/randomjoke.py`)
This script displays a random programming-themed joke from a predefined list. Users can request multiple jokes in a session.

### 3. User Interaction Example (`week1/user.py`)
A basic script that prints a greeting message. This file serves as a simple example of a Python script.

### 4. Lesson 2 Examples (`week1/lesson2.py`)
This script contains various examples of Python data types, including numeric types, lists, tuples, strings, sets, and dictionaries. It serves as an educational resource for learning Python basics.

### 5. Quiz Game (`week1/quizgame.py`)
An interactive quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the user, validates their answers, and keeps track of their score. Users can play multiple rounds.

### 6. Basic Calculator (`assgn1.py`)
A simple calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. It handles division by zero and invalid operations.

### 7. List Comprehension Filter (`week2/codechallenges/listsco.py`)
This program stores a list of words and uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the words that have an odd number of characters.

### 8. Set Intersection (`week2/codechallenges/sets.py`)
This program accepts user input to create two sets of integers and then creates a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

### 9. Personal Information Dictionary (`week2/codechallenges/infodict.py`)
This script prompts the user for their name, age, and favorite color, storing this information in a dictionary and displaying it in a user-friendly format.

### 10. Integer List Sum (`week2/codechallenges/int.py`)
This program accepts user input to create a list of integers and computes the sum of all integers in that list.

### 11. Favorite Books Tuple (`week2/codechallenges/tuple.py`)
This script creates a tuple containing the names of five favorite books and prints each book name on a separate line.

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, simply execute the corresponding Python file in your terminal. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Requirements
No external libraries are required for these scripts; they utilize built-in Python functionalities.
