# POWER LEARN PROJECT FEBRUARY COHORT 2025

## Overview
This project contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts and functionalities. Each script serves a different purpose, providing interactive experiences for users. The project also includes assignments and examples covering data analysis, visualization, and web development.

## Scripts

### 1. Personalized Greeting App (`week1/weeklycode.py`)
A simple application that prompts the user for their name and favorite color, then prints a personalized greeting message.

### 2. Random Joke Generator (`week1/randomjoke.py`)
This script displays a random programming-themed joke from a predefined list. Users can request multiple jokes in a session.

### 3. User Interaction Example (`week1/user.py`)
A basic script that prints a greeting message. This file serves as a simple example of a Python script.

### 4. Lesson 2 Examples (`week1/lesson2.py`)
This script contains various examples of Python data types, including numeric types, lists, tuples, strings, sets, and dictionaries. It serves as an educational resource for learning Python basics.

### 5. Quiz Game (`week1/quizgame.py`)
An interactive quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the user, validates their answers, and keeps track of their score. Users can play multiple rounds.

### 6. Basic Calculator (`assgn1.py`)
A simple calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. It handles division by zero and invalid operations.

### 7. Assignment 2 (`assgn2.py`)
Contains additional programming exercises and challenges to reinforce Python skills.

### 8. Assignment 3 (`assgn3.py`)
Further exercises focusing on data structures and algorithms.

### 9. Assignment 4 (`assgn4.py`)
Advanced programming tasks including file handling and data processing.

### 10. Assignment 5 (`assgn5.py`)
Final assignment covering comprehensive Python programming concepts.

### 11. List Comprehension Filter (`week2/codechallenges/listsco.py`)
This program stores a list of words and uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the words that have an odd number of characters.

### 12. Set Intersection (`week2/codechallenges/sets.py`)
This program accepts user input to create two sets of integers and then creates a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

### 13. Personal Information Dictionary (`week2/codechallenges/infodict.py`)
This script prompts the user for their name, age, and favorite color, storing this information in a dictionary and displaying it in a user-friendly format.

### 14. Integer List Sum (`week2/codechallenges/int.py`)
This program accepts user input to create a list of integers and computes the sum of all integers in that list.

### 15. Favorite Books Tuple (`week2/codechallenges/tuple.py`)
This script creates a tuple containing the names of five favorite books and prints each book name on a separate line.

### 16. Week 3 Scripts
- `week3/function.py`: Demonstrates defining and using functions in Python.
- `week3/if.py`: Examples of conditional statements and branching.
- `week3/loop.py`: Illustrates loops including for and while loops.
- `week3/Css/style.css` and `week3/Css/index.html`: Web styling and HTML examples for week 3.

### 17. Week 5 Scripts
- `week5/ex_lib.py`: Example library functions for various tasks.
- `week5/numpy_example.py`: Demonstrates usage of NumPy for numerical computations.
- `week5/pandas_script.py`: Examples of data manipulation using pandas.
- `week5/script.js`: JavaScript file for interactive web functionality.

### 18. Week 6 Scripts
- `week6/pythonlib.py`: Custom Python library with utility functions.
- `week6/numpy.py` and `week6/numpy_example.py`: NumPy examples and utilities.
- `week6/pandas.py`, `week6/pandas_example.py`, and `week6/pandas_main.py`: Various pandas data analysis scripts.
- `week6/matplotlib_example.py`: Examples of data visualization using matplotlib.
- `week6/weeklychall.py`: Weekly challenge exercises.

### 19. Week 7 Scripts and Data
- `week7/load_iris.py`: Script to load and analyze the Iris dataset.
- `week7/Iris.csv`: Dataset file used in the analysis.

### 20. Week 8 Final Project
- `week8/finalproj.py`: Final project script integrating multiple concepts.
- `week8/owid-covid-data.csv` and `week8/processed_covid_data.csv`: Data files used in the final project.

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, simply execute the corresponding Python file in your terminal. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Some scripts may require additional libraries such as NumPy, pandas, or matplotlib, which can be installed via pip.

## Requirements
Most scripts utilize built-in Python functionalities. For data analysis and visualization scripts, the following libraries are recommended:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
